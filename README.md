## Description 
My take on a 3D game engine, something i have been working on for quite a while as a hobby project also as a school assignment. Mainly working on it to learn game engine development and modern c++ techniques. Key focus being rouge like mechanics.

## Planned Features
* Deffered Shading
* Shadow Mapping
* Post Processing (AO, Bloom, ect...)
* Multithreaded Game Event System
* Multithreaded Rendering Queue
* Procedural Level/World Generation
* [Audio Engine (OpenAL)](https://www.openal.org/)
* [Networking Layer (Asio)](https://think-async.com/Asio/)

## Compilation
Compilation should be fairly simple using cmake, just run the cmake from the command line or use the gui to create the project files
